[GamersArc](http://gamersarc.000webhostapp.com/) is a website which allows users to *register* for **PUBG Tournament** which is held twice a week.<br />

## Rules:
There are certain rules which a player who signs up has to follow:<br />
 - Atmost *100* players are allowed to sign up for a single tournament.<br />
 - There is a fee charge of *20* ruppees per player.
 - The reward per kill is *10* ruppees.
 - Users has to register through website and submit their *Gaming name*, *Email-Id* and *Paytm number*.
 - A maximum of 15 minutes are given to every player to join the game room.
 - Players have to pay the amount through paytm to a mobile number given on the website.
 
## Management & Working:
A team spectator makes a room in the game and invites the players who have registered for the tournament. Another team member handles the payment transactions of the players.<br />
While being in the game, the spectator keeps an eye on the players and makes sure nobody cheats.
Formation of groups and all other basic options of the game all totally fine. The reward amount is then passed to the players through paytm based on their number of kills.

## Development:
The website has been developed on *HTML5*,*CSS3* and *JavaScript*.<br />
*Bootstrap* framework is used.<br />
The game handler and the team manager are two friends of mine.
